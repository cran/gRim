* stepwise should have a "joggle" option.

* ggmfit should return number of iterations

* Separate data processing for cmod (so that S needs not be calculated
  in each step in stepwise).

* Plot factor graphs

* A local (random?) search would be nice.

* testdelete -> testdrop

* testadd / testdrop -> testAdd / testDrop ?

* Should perhaps be clear from the names that these functions work on
  edges rather than on interaction terms? 

* Note: addEdge / removeEdge are standard generics.

* We could have addEdgeTest, dropEdgeTest, addTermTest, dropTermTest.

* Need decomposable.edge.deletion.test() function
  so as to get the degrees of freedom right with sparse data.
