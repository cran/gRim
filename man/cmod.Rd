\title{Graphical Gaussian model}
\description{
  Specification of graphical Gaussian model. The 'c' in the name
  \code{cmod} refers to that it is a (graphical) model for 'c'ontinuous variables
}
\usage{
cmod(formula, data, marginal = NULL, fit = TRUE, details=0)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{formula}{Model specification in one of the following forms:
    1) a right-hand sided formula,
    2) as a list of generators,
    3) an undirected graph (represented either as a graphNEL object or as an adjacency
    matrix).
    Notice that there are certain model
    specification shortcuts, see Section 'details' below}
  \item{data}{Data in one of the following forms: 1) A dataframe or 2) a
  list with elements \code{cov} and \code{n.obs} (such as returned by
  the \code{cov.wt()} function.) }
  \item{marginal}{Should only a subset of the variables be used in
    connection with the model specification shortcuts}
  \item{fit}{Should the model be fitted.}
  \item{details}{Control the amount of output; for debugging purposes.}
}
\details{
  The independence model can be specified as \code{~.^1} and the
  saturated model as \code{~.^.}. The \code{marginal}
  argument can be used for specifying the independence or saturated
  models for only a subset of the variables.
